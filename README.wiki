==Project Overview==

Welcome to Collider++!

==Getting Started==

===Dependencies===

* [http://www.boost.org/ Boost 1.53.0] for the network sending/receiving. You WILL need to build some of the non-header only libraries. Following the basic build and install process under section 5 here [http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_53_0/more/getting_started/unix-variants.html] will do the trick.

===Building and Installing===

# Install the dependencies above, if you haven't already done so
# Get the Collider++ source code from the [https://github.com/colliderplusplus/colliderplusplus Github repository:]<pre>git clone git://github.com/colliderplusplus/colliderplusplus.git</pre>
# Goto the root directory of the repo
# Compile with <pre>make</pre>
#* With sudo priviledges, you can install with <pre>make install</pre>
